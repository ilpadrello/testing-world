# PUG

What is pug? Pug is a template engine that let's you create easly HTML templates.

## Install PUG for Nodejs

```
// This will install the CLI for pug use the -g for install global
npm i pug-cli
//This will install the template engine as a module for your node application
npm i pug
```

For our project we are going to install it as a module, and we will create a function that will translate the `.pug` files into `.html` files.

## First template render

This is a first test to see if everything works out well.
Lesson numnber 0 : Using `|` you dont get HTML but just text, this is usefull if you want to template an SMS or a PUSH notification.
