# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

For this project tutorial, I have created a lib that let you create html files from `.pug` file.

Go to `index.js` modify the name of the template you want to render and run it.

You can also change the payload to what you want!

The HTML output will be in the html folder, the file will have the same name as the .pug you are creating.

## Structuring by lessons

The idea is that there are different lessons, you can find those lessons inside the thessons folder, each lesson should be provided with a .js file and a .pug file that has the same name as the lesson.

This way you can run each lesson and test things out!
